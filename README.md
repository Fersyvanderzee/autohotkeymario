An AutoHotKey script in order to capture the input from a SNES controller with USB to an unfocussed window.

Windows 10 requires a window to be focussed in order to capture input.
I wanted to play a game on a SNES emulator whilst simultaneously record the notes in Ableton in order to make music based on the input needed for the game.
